# BigDataProject

In order to run the Shiny App, you must first run the following files:
- platform_tree_model.R
- region_model_sript.R

After running those files, you can run the Shiny App which can be found in app.R. This will bring you to the "About" page and you can go between the different models and visuals from there.
